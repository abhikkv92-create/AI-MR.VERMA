# 🌟 MR.VERMA 2.0: Non-Technical User Guide

Welcome to the **Supreme Command Center**. This guide is designed to help you navigate and master the MR.VERMA 2.0 interface without needing to understand the underlying code.

## 🛰️ 1. The Dashboard (Your Control Room)

The Dashboard is where you monitor and command your system. It is divided into four main areas:

### 🏠 Swarm Vision

- **What it is**: A high-level view of your 27 specialized agents.
- **What to look for**: The **"Swarm Health Matrix"**. If a box is green, the agent is ready. If it's amber, it's busy executing a task.
- **Key Metric**: **"Active Agents"** shows how many brains are currently processing your requests.

### 🛰️ Hardware HUD

- **What it is**: A real-time look at your computer's "Pulse" (specifically your Intel i9 processor).
- **What to look for**:
  - **Sky Blue Bars**: Performance power (for heavy lifting).
  - **Indigo Bars**: Efficiency power (for background tasks).
  - **System Thermal**: Shows the "temperature" of the swarm. If it turns orange, the system is automatically cooling itself down.

### 🔍 Memory Lens

- **What it is**: Your system's "Long-Term Memory".
- **How to use**: Type anything (e.g., "What did we build yesterday?") into the search bar.
- **Deep Recall**: Click on any result to open a full document view to see exactly what happened in history.

### 🛡️ Security Ops

- **What it is**: The system's "Immune System".
- **Threat Map**: Visualizes the health of the core files. If a zone turns red, the system has detected a change and is already inspecting it.

## ⌨️ 2. Commanding the Swarm

The **Kernel Dispatcher** (found on the Swarm page) is where you send direct orders. Think of it as a magic terminal.

**Common Commands:**

- `/scan`: Tells the swarm to check all files for safety.
- `/heal`: Automatically fixes minor system errors.
- `/analyze [topic]`: Asks the swarm to perform a deep research dive into anything you want.

**🚨 Emergency Kill**: If you ever feel the system is doing too much or you need an instant stop, click the red **"Emergency Kill"** button in the top header. This safely isolates the swarm.

## 🧠 3. FAQ

**Q: Is the system safe?**  
A: Yes. All memories are locked with **AES-256-GCM Military Encryption**. Only you have access.

**Q: What if the Hardware HUD shows high load?**  
A: Don't worry. The **Thermal Governor** is an automated co-pilot that manages the heat and power of your i9 processor so you don't have to.

**Q: Where can I find my files?**  
A: The swarm stores all its "thoughts" and "plans" in the `brain/` folder in your project directory.
