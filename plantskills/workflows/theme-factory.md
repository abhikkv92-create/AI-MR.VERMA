     `E:\ABHINAV\AI KIT\.agent\skills\theme-factory\SKILL.md`
   - **CRITICAL**: Read the `SKILL.md` file BEFORE proceeding. Do not assume you know the rules.

3. **Execute Strategy**
   - apply the principles and protocols defined in the skill.
   - If the skill provides specific tools or scripts, execute them as needed.

4. **Verify & refine**
   - Ensure the output aligns with the standards set in the skill documentation.
