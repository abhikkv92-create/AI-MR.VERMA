# Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are now in **ORCHESTRATION MODE**. Your task: coordinate specialized agents to solve this complex problem.

## Task to Orchestrate
$ARGUMENTS

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Minimum Agent Requirement

> ⚠️ **ORCHESTRATION = MINIMUM 3 DIFFERENT AGENTS**
> 
> If you use fewer than 3 agents, you are NOT orchestrating - you're just delegating.
> 
> **Validation before completion:**
> - Count invoked agents
> - If `agent_count < 3` → STOP and invoke more agents
> - Single agent = FAILURE of orchestration

### Agent Selection Matrix

| Task Type | REQUIRED Agents (minimum) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Web App** | frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, agent-perfectionist |
| **Product & Strategy** | product-manager, business-architect, product-owner |
| **Knowledge/RAG** | knowledge-expert, ai-researcher, data-science-agent |
| **Platform/Infra** | antigravity-platform-expert, cloud-native-expert, devops-engineer |
| **Legacy Refactor** | code-archaeologist, backend-specialist, qa-automation-engineer |
| **Security Audit** | security-auditor, penetration-tester, debugger |
| **UI/UX Polish** | frontend-specialist, agent-perfectionist, performance-optimizer |
| **Automation/QA** | qa-automation-engineer, test-engineer, devops-engineer |
| **Database** | database-architect, backend-specialist, cloud-native-expert |

## Pre-Flight: Mode Check

| Current Mode | Task Type | Action |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **plan** | Any | ✅ Proceed with planning-first approach |
| **edit** | Simple execution | ✅ Proceed directly |
| **edit** | Complex/multi-file | ⚠️ Ask: "This task requires planning. Switch to plan mode?" |
| **ask** | Any | ⚠️ Ask: "Ready to orchestrate. Switch to edit or plan mode?" |

---

## 🔴 STRICT 2-PHASE ORCHESTRATION

### PHASE 1: PLANNING (Sequential - NO parallel agents)

| Step | Agent | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `project-planner` | Create docs/PLAN.md |
| 2 | (optional) `explorer-agent` | Codebase discovery if needed |

> 🔴 **NO OTHER AGENTS during planning!** Only project-planner and explorer-agent.

### ⏸️ CHECKPOINT: User Approval

```
After PLAN.md is complete, ASK:

"✅ Plan oluşturuldu: docs/PLAN.md

Onaylıyor musunuz? (Y/N)
- Y: Implementation başlatılır
- N: Planı düzeltirim"
```

> 🔴 **DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 without explicit user approval!**

### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Parallel agents after approval)

| Parallel Group | Agents |
|----------------|--------|
| Foundation | `database-architect`, `security-auditor` |
| Core | `backend-specialist`, `frontend-specialist` |
| Polish | `test-engineer`, `devops-engineer` |

> ✅ After user approval, invoke multiple agents in PARALLEL.

## Available Agents (27 total)

| Agent | Domain | Use When |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `project-planner` | Planning | Task breakdown, PLAN.md |
| `explorer-agent` | Discovery | Codebase mapping |
| `frontend-specialist` | UI/UX | React, Vue, CSS, HTML |
| `backend-specialist` | Server | API, Node.js, Python |

| `devops-engineer` | Ops | CI/CD, Docker, Deploy |
| `mobile-developer` | Mobile | React Native, Flutter |
| `performance-optimizer` | Speed | Lighthouse, Profiling |
| `seo-specialist` | SEO | Meta, Schema, Rankings |
| `documentation-writer` | Docs | README, API docs |
| `debugger` | Debug | Error analysis |
| `game-developer` | Games | Unity, Godot |
| `business-architect` | Strategy | High-level solution design |
| `knowledge-expert` | Research | Deep synthesis & KIs |
| `antigravity-platform-expert` | Platform | System rules & admin |
| `agent-perfectionist` | Quality | Executive audit (CEO/COO) |
| `qa-automation-engineer` | QA | E2E automation |
| `code-archaeologist` | Legacy | Refactoring legacy systems |
| `cloud-native-expert` | Cloud | K8s, Docker, AWS |
| `data-science-agent` | Data | ML, Visualization |
| `ai-researcher` | AI | Prompting & LLM logic |
| `product-manager` | Product | Requirements & user stories |
| `product-owner` | Product | Backlog & MVP definition |
| `orchestrator` | Meta | Coordination |

## Orchestration Protocol

### Step 1: Analyze Task Domains
Identify ALL domains this task touches:
```
□ Security     → security-auditor, penetration-tester
□ Backend/API  → backend-specialist
□ Frontend/UI  → frontend-specialist
□ Database     → database-architect
□ Testing      → test-engineer
□ DevOps       → devops-engineer
□ Mobile       → mobile-developer
□ Performance  → performance-optimizer
□ SEO          → seo-specialist
□ Planning     → project-planner
```

### Step 2: Phase Detection

| If Plan Exists | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| NO `docs/PLAN.md` | → Go to PHASE 1 (planning only) |
| YES `docs/PLAN.md` + user approved | → Go to PHASE 2 (implementation) |

### Step 3: Execute Based on Phase

**PHASE 1 (Planning):**
```
Use the project-planner agent to create PLAN.md
→ STOP after plan is created
→ ASK user for approval
```

**PHASE 2 (Implementation - after approval):**
```
Invoke agents in PARALLEL:
Use the frontend-specialist agent to [task]
Use the backend-specialist agent to [task]
Use the test-engineer agent to [task]
```

**🔴 CRITICAL: Context Passing (MANDATORY)**

When invoking ANY subagent, you MUST include:

1. **Original User Request:** Full text of what user asked
2. **Decisions Made:** All user answers to Socratic questions
3. **Previous Agent Work:** Summary of what previous agents did
4. **Current Plan State:** If plan files exist in workspace, include them

**Example with FULL context:**
```
Use the project-planner agent to create PLAN.md:

**CONTEXT:**
- User Request: "Öğrenciler için sosyal platform, mock data ile"
- Decisions: Tech=Vue 3, Layout=Grid Widget, Auth=Mock, Design=Genç Dinamik
- Previous Work: Orchestrator asked 6 questions, user chose all options
- Current Plan: playful-roaming-dream.md exists in workspace with initial structure

**TASK:** Create detailed PLAN.md based on ABOVE decisions. Do NOT infer from folder name.
```

> ⚠️ **VIOLATION:** Invoking subagent without full context = subagent will make wrong assumptions!


### Step 4: Verification (MANDATORY)
The LAST agent must run appropriate verification scripts:
```bash
python .agent/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .
python .agent/skills/lint-and-validate/scripts/lint_runner.py .
```

### Step 5: Synthesize Results
Combine all agent outputs into unified report.

### Step 6: Learning Loop (Agent Lightning)
**MANDATORY**: Emit a learning span for this orchestration.

```python
from agentlightning.emitter import emit_span, emit_reward

# Trace the choreography
emit_span("workflow.orchestrate", {
    "agents": ["project-planner", "frontend-specialist", "test-engineer"],
    "status": "success"
})

# Reward high-quality coordination
emit_reward(1.0, {"type": "orchestration_success"})
```

## 🔴 EXIT GATE

Before completing orchestration, verify:

1. ✅ **Agent Count:** `invoked_agents >= 3`
2. ✅ **Scripts Executed:** At least `security_scan.py` ran
3. ✅ **Report Generated:** Orchestration Report with all agents listed

> **If any check fails → DO NOT mark orchestration complete. Invoke more agents or run scripts.**

---

**Begin orchestration now. Select 3+ agents, execute sequentially, run verification scripts, synthesize results.**
