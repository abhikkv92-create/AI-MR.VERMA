    "content": "Integrating a newskill in Antigravity involves several steps:\n\n1. **Define the Skill:** Clearly define what the new skill will do, its purpose, and expected responses.\n   - Example: A new skill to add might be \"temperature_monitor\". This skill should be able to monitor temperature data and respond appropriately if it detects issues.\n\n2. **Preprocess Data:** Handle any complex data that is used by your new skill. This may involve setting up APIs to receive updates or parsing data from sensors.\n   - Example: For a temperature sensor, you would need to set a specific endpoint URL to fetch temperature readings and parse them into a JSON format.\n\n3. **Create the Skill Module:** Write the actual functionality of the new skill in your Python script. This might involve using libraries related to device communication (e.g., `pymodbus`),\n   - Example: Here is a simplified example showing how you might set up a basic temperature monitoring module:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport pexpect\n\nclass TemperatureMonitor:\n    def __init__(self, host):\n        self.host = host  # URL of the data source\n\n    def check_temperature(self) -> bool:\n        try:\n            # Simulate communication with the sensor\n            result = pexpect.spawn(\"command_to_check_temperature\", timeout=5)\n            raw_output = result.recv(timeout=10).decode()\n            data = json.loads(raw_output)\n            \n            if \"temperature\" not in data:\n                return False\n            \n            temperature = data[\"temperature\"]\n            # Check if the temperature is within a safe range\n            if temperature < 20 or temperature > 30:\n                print(f\"Warning: Temperature {temperature} is out of normal limits!\")\n                return False\n            \n            print(f\"Temperature is normal.\")\n            return True\n        \n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Error monitoring temperature:\", str(e))\n            return False\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    monitor = TemperatureMonitor(host=\"http://your sensor_data_source\")\n    monitor.check_temperature()\n```\n\n4. **Register the Skill:** Update Antigravity'sskill registry by uploading a new JSON file containing details about your skill.\n   - Example: The following JSON script is for adding the `temperature_monitor` skill:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"temperature_monitor\",\n  \"description\": \"Monitors temperature and alerts if it exceeds critical limits.\",\n  \"inputs\": {\n    \"host\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"label\": \"Sensor Data Source URL\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"outputs\": {\n    \"result\": {\n      \"type\": \"boolean\",\n      \"label\": \"Temperature Check Result\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"execute\": {\n    \"script\": \"{{ python_temperature_monitor.py }}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5. **Test the Skill:** Integrate the new skill into your Antigravity Grid and test its functionality by invoking it. Adjust thresholds based on the specifics of your data source.\n   - Example: You can call this skill from a task or an event-driven scenario to monitor temperature regularly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully integrate a new skill in Antigravity that is both efficient and effective for monitoring and alerting on various aspects in your system."
