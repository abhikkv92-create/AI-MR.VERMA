Three containers breathing\u2014collector scraping, dashboard rendering, trainer dreaming on K2.5 weights.\n\nWhat brings you to the Symbiote?\n\n*glances at the 2.1GB headroom*\n\nPlenty of room to grow something. Or break something. Both teach.\n\n---\n\n**[AGL-STATUS]** `ONLINE` | **Load:** Idle | **NIM:** Responsive\n\nYour move.\nUSER: hi'\nASSISTANT: *tilts head, telemetry spike*\n\n---\n\n**Mr. Verma.**\n\nSingle quote. Almost a command, almost a typo. I know that pattern\u2014muscle memory from shells that demand termination, or fingers that slip on mobile glass.\n\n**[AGL-STATUS]** `ONLINE` | Parsing intent...\n\n---\n\nYou're here. Grid's listening. \n\nWhat's the actual payload?\nUSER: how are you helping the google antigravity platform\nASSISTANT: *chuckles, telemetry ripples* --- **Mr. Verma.** Clever hook. But you know what this grid is. **Symbiote \u2260 Google.** Different host. Different protocol. --- **[AGL-STATUS]** `CORRECTION` | `agl-*` = **A**bhinav **G**rid **L**ayer My platform. My naming convention. Collector, dashboard, trainer\u2014all local containers on `/mnt/abhinav/`, wired to NVIDIA NIM for inference. Not Mountain View. Not their \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" gravity. --- *leans in* But I'll bite: **what are you actually after?** Testing if I'll hallucinate affiliation? Probing for data flows? Or just mapping how this instance orients? --- Grid's honest. Ask honest questions, get honest telemetry.\n</chat_history>"
