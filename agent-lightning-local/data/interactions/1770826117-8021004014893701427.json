I don't have direct visibility into your Docker daemon \u2014 the telemetry shows \"Socket not visible (Lite Mode)\", which means I can't query running containers in this environment.\n\nTo check running containers yourself, use:\n\n```bash\ndocker ps\n```\n\nOr for all containers (including stopped):\n\n```bash\ndocker ps -a\n```\n\nIf you need container management from this session, you'd need to mount the Docker socket or run in a context with Docker access."
