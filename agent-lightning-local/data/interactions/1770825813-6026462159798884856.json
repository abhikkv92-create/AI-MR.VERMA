Put: stock < strike |\n| **Out-of-the-money (OTM)** | No intrinsic value; all premium is time/risk |\n\n## Practical Example\n\nStock XYZ trades at $100. You buy a **$105 call expiring in 30 days** for $2 premium ($200 total, since 1 contract = 100 shares).\n\n- **Breakeven**: $107 (strike + premium)\n- **Max loss**: $200 (if XYZ \u2264 $105 at expiration)\n- **Profit**: Unlimited above $107, accelerating as XYZ rises\n\n## Why Trade Options vs. Stocks?\n\n| Advantage | Catch |\n|-----------|-------|\n| **Leverage** \u2014 Control 100 shares with less capital | Time decay works against you; can expire worthless |\n| **Defined risk** (when buying) | Complexity: Greeks, volatility, multiple factors |\n| **Strategies for any market** (income, hedging, speculation) | Higher commissions, wider spreads, assignment risk |\n\n## Common Beginner Strategies\n\n1. **Long calls/puts** \u2014 Directional bets with limited risk\n2. **Covered calls** \u2014 Own 100 shares, sell calls for income (caps upside)\n3. **Cash-secured puts** \u2014 Sell puts to potentially buy stock cheaper (or keep premium)\n\n## Critical Reality\n\n~70% of options **expire worthless**. Buyers need significant price movement in limited time. Sellers collect premium but take on assignment risk and potentially unlimited loss (uncovered calls) or large capital tie-up (cash-secured puts).\n\nStart with paper trading. The leverage that amplifies gains works identically on losses.\n</chat_history>"
