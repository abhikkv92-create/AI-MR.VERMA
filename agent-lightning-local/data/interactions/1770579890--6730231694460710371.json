    "content": "To integrate a new skill in Antigravity, you'll need access to an API that provides training on the new skill and then use it with the Antigravity Engine. Here's an example of how you could do this using the OpenAI API:\n\n```python\n# Install openai package if you haven't already\npip install openai\n\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom openai import Completion\n\n# Set the environment variables for your OpenAI API key and base URL\nos.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your apiKey'\nos.environ['ANTIGRAVITY_ENGINE_URL'] = 'http://localhost:10001/api'\n\ndef learn_skill(prompt):\n    # Prepare a task description along with the prompt\n    task_description = \"Instruct me to implement this skill in Python.\"\n    combined_text = f\"# Task Description\\n{task_description}\\n\\n# Prompt\\n{prompt}\"\n\n    response = Completion.create(\n        engine=\"gpt-4\",\n        prompt=combined_text,\n        max_tokens=500\n    )\n\n    learning_prompt = json.loads(response.choices[0].text)\n\n    # Use the learning prompts to train your custom skill\n    with open(\"skill_trainings.json\", \"a\") as f:\n        f.write(json.dumps(learning_prompt) + \"\\n\")\n\n# Example prompt for the new skill\nexample_task = \"@Model, Please teach me how to create a new endpoint on a web server using NodeJS.\"\n\nlearn_skill(example_task)\n```\n\nIn this example, we first install and set up the `openai` Python package. We then create a function `learn_skill` that sends a prompt to OpenAI's GPT-4 engine for training the newly integrated skill. The response includes a task description and instructions on how to implement the skill in Python. Finally, we write the learning prompts to a JSON file called `skill_trainings.json`, which is then used to train the skill using the Antigravity Engine.\n\nNote that you will need to replace `'your apiKey'` with your actual OpenAI API key and update the `ANTIGRAVITY_ENGINE_URL` environment variable to point to the URL of your custom Antigravity Engine server."
