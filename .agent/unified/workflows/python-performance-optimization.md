# python-performance-optimization Workflow

1. **Analyze Request**
   - Understand the user's specific need regarding **python-performance-optimization**.
   - Identify if the task involves python-performance-optimization best practices, specific patterns, or tool usage.

2. **Activate Skill**
   - Use the `view_file` tool to read the full instructions in:
     `E:\ABHINAV\AI KIT\.agent\skills\python-performance-optimization\SKILL.md`
   - **CRITICAL**: Read the `SKILL.md` file BEFORE proceeding. Do not assume you know the rules.
