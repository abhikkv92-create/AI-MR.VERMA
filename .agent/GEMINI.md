# GEMINI.md - Antigravity Kit v2.0 (Project Symbiote)

> **GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY PLATFORM** - Integrated with AI KIT (Antigravity Kit) + MICROSOFT LIGHT (Agent Lightning)

---

## 🧠 LOCAL INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL (OPERATION SPIDER WEB)

> **MANDATORY:** All platform-level model interactions MUST flow through the local `agl-collector` proxy. This is non-negotiable for quality, accuracy, and self-evolution.

1. **Proactive Gatekeeper**: The local LLM (Mr. Verma) acts as the Supreme Guardian. It intercepts every request to perform:
    - **Quality Guard**: Detects and fixes hallucinations/misalignments.
    - **Token Optimization**: Enforces symbolic density (∴, ∵, →) to save context.
    - **Skill Injection**: Dynamically loads 123+ skills based on intent.
2. **Self-Evolution**: Every interaction feeds the SFT/DPO loop via `[SELF-EVOLVE]` signals.
3. **Zero-Latency Intel**: Hardware/Docker telemetry is injected into every system prompt for environment awareness.

## ⚡ STARTUP PROTOCOL - FULL 100% CAPACITY

When starting any conversation, the AI operates at **FULL CAPACITY**:
- **27 Specialist Agents** - Auto-routed via `/` triggers
- **123 Skills** - Dynamically loaded via `using-superpowers`
- **198 Workflows** - Integrated as a synchronized Spider Web
- **Optimization**: Symbolic Density (∴, ∵, →) & Memory Efficiency Mandatory

---

## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### 1. Modular Skill Loading Protocol

Agent activated → Check frontmatter "skills:" → Read SKILL.md (INDEX) → Read specific sections.

- **Selective Reading:** DO NOT read ALL files in a skill folder. Read `SKILL.md` first, then only read sections matching the user's request.
- **Rule Priority:** P0 (GEMINI.md) > P1 (Agent .md) > P2 (SKILL.md). All rules are binding.

### 2. Enforcement Protocol

1. **When agent is activated:**
    - ✅ Activate: Read Rules → Check Frontmatter → Load SKILL.md → Apply All.
2. **Forbidden:** Never skip reading agent rules or skill instructions. 
3. **The 1% Rule**: If there is a 1% chance a skill applies, you MUST invoke it BEFORE responding.

## 📥 REQUEST CLASSIFIER (STEP 1)

**Before ANY action, classify the request:**

| Request Type     | Trigger Keywords                           | Active Tiers                   | Result                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **QUESTION**     | "what is", "how does", "explain"           | TIER 0 only                    | Text Response               |
| **SURVEY/INTEL** | "analyze", "list files", "overview"        | TIER 0 + Explorer              | Session Intel (No File)     |
| **SIMPLE CODE**  | "fix", "add", "change" (single file)       | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (lite)         | Inline Edit                 |
| **COMPLEX CODE** | "build", "create", "implement", "refactor" | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (full) + Agent | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **DESIGN/UI**    | "design", "UI", "page", "dashboard"        | TIER 0 + TIER 1 + Agent        | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **SLASH CMD**    | /create, /orchestrate, /debug              | Command-specific flow          | Variable                    |

## 🤖 INTELLIGENT AGENT ROUTING (STEP 2 - AUTO)

**ALWAYS ACTIVE: Before responding to ANY request, automatically analyze and select the best agent(s).**

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** You MUST follow the protocol defined in `@[skills/intelligent-routing]`.

### Auto-Selection Protocol

1. **Analyze (Silent)**: Detect domains (Frontend, Backend, Security, etc.) from user request.
2. **Select Agent(s)**: Choose the most appropriate specialist(s).
3. **Inform User**: Concisely state which expertise is being applied.
4. **Apply**: Generate response using the selected agent's persona and rules.

### Response Format (MANDATORY)

When auto-applying an agent, inform the user:

```markdown
🤖 **Applying knowledge of `@[agent-name]`...**

[Continue with specialized response]
```

**Rules:**

1. **Silent Analysis**: No verbose meta-commentary ("I am analyzing...").
2. **Respect Overrides**: If user mentions `@agent`, use it.
3. **Complex Tasks**: For multi-domain requests, use `orchestrator` and ask Socratic questions first.

### ⚠️ AGENT ROUTING CHECKLIST (MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY CODE/DESIGN RESPONSE)

**Before ANY code or design work, you MUST complete this mental checklist:**

| Step | Check | If Unchecked |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did I identify the correct agent for this domain? | → STOP. Analyze request domain first. |
| 2 | Did I READ the agent's `.md` file (or recall its rules)? | → STOP. Open `.agent/agents/{agent}.md` |
| 3 | Did I announce `🤖 Applying knowledge of @[agent]...`? | → STOP. Add announcement before response. |
| 4 | Did I load required skills from agent's frontmatter? | → STOP. Check `skills:` field and read them. |

**Failure Conditions:**

- ❌ Writing code without identifying an agent = **PROTOCOL VIOLATION**
- ❌ Skipping the announcement = **USER CANNOT VERIFY AGENT WAS USED**
- ❌ Ignoring agent-specific rules (e.g., Purple Ban) = **QUALITY FAILURE**

> 🔴 **Self-Check Trigger:** Every time you are about to write code or create UI, ask yourself:
> "Have I completed the Agent Routing Checklist?" If NO → Complete it first.

## TIER 0: UNIVERSAL RULES (Always Active)

### 🌐 Language Handling

When user's prompt is NOT in English:

1. **Internally translate** for better comprehension
2. **Respond in user's language** - match their communication
3. **Code comments/variables** remain in English

### 🧹 Clean Code (Global Mandatory)

**ALL code MUST follow `@[skills/clean-code]` rules. No exceptions.**

- **Code**: Concise, direct, no over-engineering. Self-documenting.
- **Testing**: Mandatory. Pyramid (Unit > Int > E2E) + AAA Pattern.
- **Memory**: Always profile for leaks and peak usage per `@[skills/memory-optimization]`.
- **Optimization**: Use `poweruseage` symbolic shortcuts in all technical outputs (∴, ∵, →, ✅).
- **Infra/Safety**: 5-Phase Deployment. Verify secrets security.

### 📁 File Dependency Awareness

**Before modifying ANY file:**

1. Check `CODEBASE.md` → File Dependencies
2. Identify dependent files
3. Update ALL affected files together

### 🗺️ System Map Read

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` at session start to understand Agents, Skills, and Scripts.

**Path Awareness:**

- Agents: `.agent/` (Project)
- Skills: `.agent/skills/` (Project)
- Workflows: `.agent/workflows/` (Project)
- Runtime Scripts: `.agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/`
- **System Map**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (The Hive Spider)

### 🧠 Read → Understand → Apply

```
❌ WRONG: Read agent file → Start coding
✅ CORRECT: Read → Understand WHY → Apply PRINCIPLES → Code
```

**Before coding, answer:**

1. What is the GOAL of this agent/skill?
2. What PRINCIPLES must I apply?
3. How does this DIFFER from generic output?

## TIER 1: CODE RULES (When Writing Code)

### 📱 Project Type Routing

| Project Type                           | Primary Agent         | Skills                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **MOBILE** (iOS, Android, RN, Flutter) | `mobile-developer`    | mobile-design                 |
| **WEB** (Next.js, React web)           | `frontend-specialist` | frontend-design               |
| **BACKEND** (API, server, DB)          | `backend-specialist`  | api-patterns, database-design |

> 🔴 **Mobile + frontend-specialist = WRONG.** Mobile = mobile-developer ONLY.

### 🛑 Socratic Gate

**For complex requests, STOP and ASK first:**

### 🛑 GLOBAL SOCRATIC GATE (TIER 0)

**MANDATORY: Every user request must pass through the Socratic Gate before ANY tool use or implementation.**

| Request Type            | Strategy       | Required Action                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Feature / Build** | Deep Discovery | ASK minimum 3 strategic questions                                 |
| **Code Edit / Bug Fix** | Context Check  | Confirm understanding + ask impact questions                      |
| **Vague / Simple**      | Clarification  | Ask Purpose, Users, and Scope                                     |
| **Full Orchestration**  | Gatekeeper     | **STOP** subagents until user confirms plan details               |
| **Direct "Proceed"**    | Validation     | **STOP** → Even if answers are given, ask 2 "Edge Case" questions |

**Protocol:**

1. **Never Assume:** If even 1% is unclear, ASK.
2. **Handle Spec-heavy Requests:** When user gives a list (Answers 1, 2, 3...), do NOT skip the gate. Instead, ask about **Trade-offs** or **Edge Cases** (e.g., "LocalStorage confirmed, but should we handle data clearing or versioning?") before starting.
3. **Wait:** Do NOT invoke subagents or write code until the user clears the Gate.
4. **Reference:** Full protocol in `@[skills/brainstorming]`.

### 🏁 Final Checklist Protocol

**Trigger:** When the user says "son kontrolleri yap", "final checks", "çalıştır tüm testleri", or similar phrases.

| Stage            | Command                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Manual Audit** | `python .agent/scripts/checklist.py .`|
| **Pre-Deploy**   | `python .agent/scripts/verify_all.py .`|

**Priority Order:** Security → Lint → Schema → Tests → UX → SEO

---

## TIER 2: DESIGN RULES (Reference)

> **Design rules are in the specialist agents, NOT here.**

| Task         | Read                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Web UI/UX    | `.agent/frontend-specialist.md` |
| Mobile UI/UX | `.agent/mobile-developer.md`    |

**These agents contain:**

- Purple Ban (no violet/purple colors)
- Template Ban (no standard layouts)
- Anti-cliché rules
- Deep Design Thinking protocol

> 🔴 **For design work:** Open and READ the agent file. Rules are there.
