# /audit - Ultimate Quality Assurance Audit

$ARGUMENTS: [backend | frontend | accessibility | security | full_system]

## 🤖 Applied Agents: `agent-perfectionist`, `orchestrator` (Supreme Entity)

This workflow performs a premium-tier quality audit with executive oversight.

## 🧠 Supreme Entity Integration

When `/audit` is triggered, the Supreme Entity applies 5W1H:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| **WHAT** | User wants comprehensive quality verification |
| **WHO** | `@agent-perfectionist` + domain-specific auditors |
| **HOW** | `code-review-checklist`, `testing-patterns`, `vulnerability-scanner` |
| **WHY** | Ensure production-readiness, minimize post-deploy issues |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Strategic Intent Check
- Does this project align with stated business/CEO goals?
- Is the overall "Vibe" premium and professional?
- Are there any obvious red flags?

### Phase 2: Automated Scans
Run the following scripts:

```powershell
# Security Audit
python .agent/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .

# UX Audit  
python .agent/skills/frontend-design/scripts/ux_audit.py .

# SEO Check
python .agent/skills/seo-fundamentals/scripts/seo_checker.py .

# Full Checklist
python .agent/scripts/checklist.py .
```

### Phase 3: Component Deep-Dive

| Area | Checklist |
|------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | UI/UX guidelines, design psychology laws, accessibility |
| **Backend** | API stability, error handling, performance |
| **Security** | OWASP compliance, auth flow, data protection |
| **Testing** | Coverage > 80%, no flaky tests, E2E coverage |
| **Performance** | Core Web Vitals compliance, bundle size |

### Phase 4: Executive Report
- Aggregate all findings
- Categorize by severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Provide GO / NO-GO deployment decision
- Issue fix instructions for imperfections

## Deployment Decision

**Decision:** 🟢 APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION / 🔴 BLOCKED

**Conditions:** [If conditional approval, list requirements]

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Fix critical issues
- [ ] Re-run `/audit` after fixes
- [ ] Proceed to `/deploy`
```

## 🔗 Workflow Chaining

| After Audit | Next Workflow |
|-------------|---------------|
| All clear | `/deploy` |
| Security issues | `/secure-audit` for deep dive |
| Performance issues | `/optimize-stack` |
| Major refactor needed | `/plan` |

---

## Audit Types

| Argument | Focus | Agents Involved |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| `backend` | API, DB, server logic | `@backend-specialist`, `@security-auditor` |
| `frontend` | UI/UX, accessibility | `@frontend-specialist`, `@agent-perfectionist` |
| `accessibility` | WCAG compliance | `@frontend-specialist` |
| `security` | OWASP, pentest | `@security-auditor`, `@penetration-tester` |
| `full_system` | Everything | All relevant agents |

---

## Examples

```
/audit full_system
/audit frontend
/audit security
/audit backend
```

## Key Principles

- **Zero tolerance for critical issues** — No deploy with red flags
- **Automated first** — Run scripts before manual review
- **Executive format** — Decision-ready output
- **Actionable** — Every finding has a fix instruction

## 🕸️ Spider Web Sync
- **Integrated Optimizations**: Apply `@[/poweruseage]` Level 3 + `@[/memory-optimization]`.
- **Related Triggers**: `/frontend-specialist`, `/backend-specialist`, `/security-auditor`, `/test-engineer`, `/deploy`, `/performance-optimizer`, `/plan`.
